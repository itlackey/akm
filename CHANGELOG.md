## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`akm workflow validate <ref|path>`** — new subcommand that validates a workflow markdown file or ref, surfacing every error in one pass (without running a full reindex).
- **`akm feedback` now accepts any indexed ref** — previously type-restricted. `memory:`, `vault:`, `workflow:`, `wiki:` refs all work. Vault feedback never echoes vault values.
- **`akm upgrade` runs post-upgrade tasks automatically.** After a successful upgrade, the new binary is invoked as a child process running `akm index`, which auto-migrates any legacy `stashes` → `sources` config keys via `loadConfig` and rebuilds the index against the new schema (`DB_VERSION` 8 → 9 forces a rebuild). Pass `--skip-post-upgrade` to opt out (config migration still runs on the next `akm` invocation; you'd just need to run `akm index` yourself). Result is reported in the `postUpgrade` field of the upgrade response.
- **`writable` flag on sources.** New optional `SourceConfigEntry.writable` controls whether write commands (`akm remember`, `akm import`, `akm save`, `akm clone`) may target the source. Defaults: `true` for `filesystem`, `false` for `git` / `website` / `npm`. `writable: true` on `website` or `npm` is rejected at config load with `ConfigError("writable: true is only supported on filesystem and git sources")`.
- **`defaultWriteTarget` root config key.** Names the source that receives writes when no `--target` flag is given. Resolution order: `--target` → `defaultWriteTarget` → `stashDir` (working stash) → `ConfigError("no writable source configured; run \`akm init\`")`. There is no implicit "first writable in `sources[]` order" fallback.

### Changed

- **Workflows are now stored as validated `WorkflowDocument` JSON** — workflows are compiled into a validated `WorkflowDocument` JSON shape with line-anchored `SourceRef`s back into the source markdown, cached in a new `workflow_documents` table in `index.db`. The run engine reads from the cache on `akm workflow next` instead of re-parsing markdown each step.
- **Feedback events flow into utility recomputation** — positive/negative feedback signals now feed utility scoring alongside search/show events. Telemetry records both `entry_ref` and `entry_id` so feedback signals survive a reindex.

### Changed (breaking)

- **v1 architecture refactor.** The internal architecture was rebuilt around a single minimal `SourceProvider` interface (`{ name, kind, init, path, sync? }`), a unified FTS5 index that owns search and show, and a single `writeAssetToSource` helper that owns all writes. The CLI command surface and all user-visible config keys are unchanged. See `docs/migration/v1.md` for the full guide.
- **Config key `stashes[]` renamed to `sources[]`.** Configs with the legacy key load with one deprecation warning and are auto-migrated in memory; the new key is persisted on the next `akm config` write. New configs should use `sources[]`. Configs that contain both keys are rejected with `ConfigError`.
- **Error hints surface without `--verbose`.** Error classes own their `hint()` text; the regex-on-message hint chain in `cli.ts` is removed. Hints print to stderr inline alongside the error message.
- **Registry providers loop through a uniform interface.** Context Hub is no longer a special-cased provider type. Add it as a regular git source (`akm add github:andrewyng/context-hub`) or include it as a kit in your registry index. Legacy `type: "context-hub"` entries normalize to `type: "git"` at load time.
- **Terminology cleanup — clean break from "kit" → "stash"** (#148). Pre-v1, no fallback period.
  - **Wire format**: `RegistryIndex.kits[]` renamed to `RegistryIndex.stashes[]`. Schema version bumped to **v3** — `akm-cli >= 0.6.0` only parses indexes with `version: 3`. v1/v2 indexes are no longer accepted. Every static-index registry must regenerate its `index.json` with `version: 3` to be readable. The official `akm-registry` ships a regenerated index alongside this release.
  - **Discovery**: npm packages and GitHub repos are now discovered via the `akm-stash` keyword/topic only. Legacy `akm-kit` and `agentikit` keywords/topics are no longer honored. Publishers must retag.
  - **Schemas**: `schemas/registry-index.json` and `docs/technical/registry-index.schema.json` updated (`RegistryKit` → `RegistryStash`, `kits` → `stashes`).
  - **Internal types**: `RegistryKitEntry` → `RegistryStashEntry`, `InstalledKitEntry` → `InstalledStashEntry`, `KitInstallStatus` → `StashInstallStatus`, `KitSource` → `StashSource`. Files `src/kit-include.ts` → `src/stash-include.ts` and `src/installed-kits.ts` → `src/installed-stashes.ts`.
  - **Asset hit field**: `RegistryAssetSearchHit.kit` → `RegistryAssetSearchHit.stash`.
  - **Docs**: `docs/kit-makers.md` → `docs/stash-makers.md`. All user-facing "kit" references in docs and the README replaced with "stash".
  - **Preserved**: the *Agent Kit Manager* tagline, the `akm-cli` npm package name, and the `akm.include` package.json field.
  - **Migration**: a curated registry author should regenerate their `index.json` (rename `kits` → `stashes`, drop legacy keyword filtering). Publishers should add the `akm-stash` keyword/topic and remove `akm-kit`/`agentikit`.
- **`akm registry` description**: changed from "Manage kit registries" to "Manage stash registries".

### Migration / Breaking

- **`DB_VERSION` bumped 8 → 9.** On first run after upgrade, the version-mismatch path in `ensureSchema()` drops + recreates all `index.db` tables (preserving `usage_events` via a typed backup); the next `akm index` rebuilds the index. `workflow.db` (run state) is unaffected.

### Removed (breaking)

- **OpenViking source provider.** The `openviking` source kind is no longer supported. Configs that contain one fail to load with `ConfigError("openviking is not supported in akm v1. …")` and a hint pointing to `akm config sources remove <name>`. API-backed sources will return as a separate `QuerySource` tier post-v1. To downgrade in the meantime, pin to `akm-cli@0.5`.
- **`akm enable context-hub` / `akm disable context-hub` toggles.** Add Context Hub as a regular git source (`akm add github:andrewyng/context-hub`) or list it as a kit entry in your registry; remove or disable it via `akm config sources remove context-hub` or by editing the entry's `enabled` flag.
- **Legacy re-export shims** `src/llm.ts`, `src/registry-provider.ts`, and `src/ripgrep.ts`. akm has no public API (CLI-only package, no barrel exports), so external consumers should be unaffected.

### Internal

- **`src/` reorganized into purpose-named subdirectories** (`commands/`, `core/`, `indexer/`, `output/`, `registry/`, `setup/`, `sources/`, `wiki/`, `workflows/`). No public API surface change.
- **Single `writeAssetToSource` helper** under `src/core/write-source.ts` is the only place that branches on `source.kind` to add behaviour. All write call sites (`remember`, `import`, `clone`, `save`) route through it.
- **`SourceProvider` interface simplified** to `{ name, kind, init, path, sync? }`. The previous `LiveStashProvider` / `SyncableStashProvider` split is gone.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Multi-wiki support** (#119, #121, #136, #139, #144): new `wiki` asset type with ten CLI verbs under `akm wiki …` (`create`, `register`, `list`, `show`, `remove`, `pages`, `search`, `stash`, `lint`, `ingest`). Each wiki lives at `<stashDir>/wikis/<name>/` with `schema.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`, `raw/`, and agent-authored pages. Wiki pages are first-class in stash-wide `akm search`. `akm index` regenerates each wiki's `index.md` as a side effect and is resilient to malformed workflow assets. Raw sources under `raw/` and the `schema.md` / `index.md` / `log.md` infrastructure files are intentionally excluded from the search index. See `docs/wikis.md` for the full guide. Design principle: **akm surfaces, the agent writes** — no LLM calls, no network access; akm owns only operations with invariants an agent can't reliably enforce (lifecycle, raw-slug uniqueness, structural lint, index regeneration, workflow discovery).
- **External wiki registration** (#139, #144): `akm wiki register <name> <path-or-repo>` and `akm add --type wiki --name <name> <source>` register an existing directory or git/website repo as a first-class wiki without copying or mutating it; source and wiki search state are refreshed immediately and refs/state are normalized on subsequent indexing.
- **Workflow asset type** (#118): new `workflow` type with `akm workflow` subcommands `template`, `create`, `start`, `next`, `complete`, `status`, `list`, and `resume` for authoring and stepping through multi-step workflows stored in the stash. Runs snapshot their step list at start so edits to the source workflow do not affect an in-flight run.
- **Vault asset type** (#117): new `vault` type backed by `.env` files; `akm vault` subcommand with `list`, `show`, `create`, `set`, `unset`, and `load` (emits a `source` snippet for the current shell via a mode-0600 temp file); values never appear in structured output.
- **`--trust` flag for installs**: `akm add <source> --trust` performs a one-off trusted install, bypassing the install audit for that source. Blocked install errors now include a `hint` pointing to `--trust` as a remediation option.
- **Writable git stash + `akm save`** (#114): `akm add … --writable` opts a remote git-backed stash into push-on-save; `akm save [name] [-m message]` commits (and pushes when writable + remote is set); default stash is auto-initialized as a git repo; git stash provider now uses `git clone` instead of HTTP tarball download.
- **`akm help migrate <version>`** (#132): prints the release notes and migration guidance for a given version (accepts `0.5.0`, `v0.5.0`, or `latest`). Pulls the matching section from `CHANGELOG.md` when available and supplements it with embedded migration notes for major releases.
- **Broader `akm upgrade` coverage** (#132, #134): self-update now detects and upgrades npm, bun, pnpm, and standalone-binary installs (previously binary-only). Runtime assets covered by the upgrade flow were also expanded so newly shipped asset types stay current.

### Fixed

- **0.5.0 QA follow-ups** (#130): fixes across the new wiki, workflow, vault, and save/trust surfaces surfaced during release-candidate QA.

### Removed (breaking)

- The unreleased single-wiki LLM POC: removes `akm lint` command, `akm import --llm` / `--dry-run` flags, `knowledge.pageKinds` config, and the `ingestKnowledgeSource` / `lintKnowledge` LLM prompts. Users of the POC should migrate to the new `akm wiki …` surface; raw content can be manually moved to `wikis/<name>/raw/`.

### Documentation

- **Technical docs refresh** (#138): stash and search architecture docs updated to match the current implementation.
- **Wiki configuration guide** (#115): new docs page covering wiki configuration and ingest flow.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- **`akm enable` / `akm disable`** (#108): toggle optional components (`skills.sh`, `context-hub`) on/off without manually editing config
- **`akm remember` and `akm import` commands** (#110): capture in-session knowledge directly from the CLI; `akm remember` records a memory to the default stash (supports stdin); `akm import` ingests a file or stdin as a knowledge asset
- **Karpathy-style wiki workflow in knowledge assets** (#113): `akm show knowledge:<doc>` now surfaces an `ingest` workflow for knowledge documents; `--dry-run` flag added; `pageKind` taxonomy made extensible
- Documentation: expanded `agent-install.md`, added `info` and `feedback` command docs, global flags reference (#106)

### Fixed

- Remote embedding endpoint URL normalization — trailing slashes and path segments now handled correctly (#112)
- Reduced fallback capture-name collisions in `akm remember`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Install security audit**: new pre-install scanner inspects kit contents for dangerous patterns and executable scripts before install; configurable via `config` CLI
- **Project-level config stash merging**: `.akm.json` in a project directory merges its stash/registry entries with user config during CLI runs
- **Disable inherited project stashes**: project config can disable stashes inherited from parent/user scopes
- **`akm curate` command**: new subcommand for curating assets from the stash (initial skeleton)

### Fixed

- Index nested agent markdown files as agents so `akm search agent:...` finds them
- `install-audit` now reads at most `MAX_SCANNED_FILE_BYTES` per file using `Buffer.alloc`, with the file descriptor always closed via `try/finally`, and corrects the `scannedBytes` counter

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Website stash provider**: add a URL directly as a stash source with `akm stash add <url>`; crawls the site and indexes pages as knowledge assets
- Website provider options: `--max-pages` and `--depth` flags to bound crawling

### Fixed

- Relaxed HTTP warnings for localhost website sources
- Addressed review feedback around website provider routing and security heuristics

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Regression tests for vector/semantic search readiness, install, and setup flows
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and "Why akm" section in documentation
- Three draft SEO blog posts

### Changed

- **Unified source model**: replaced the `kit` vs `stash` split with a single source concept; `akm add` works for all source types
- Removed `stash` and `kit` subcommand groups; their behaviors fold into the top-level CLI (`akm list`, `akm add`, etc.)
- Refactored semantic search readiness tracking for clearer state transitions
- Aligned documentation voice and updated older posts for the current CLI surface

### Fixed

- Embedding fingerprint is purged on model change and `usage_events` are re-linked correctly
- Local embedder dtype selection
- Release validation workflow
- Prereleases (versions with suffixes) are marked as such on GitHub releases and published to npm with `--tag next`

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Binary install detection in `akm upgrade` self-update; centralized `AKM_VERSION` declaration with binary detection tests

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Docker-based install tests covering multiple OS configurations (skipped in CI)
- Detailed error reporting in embedding availability checks
- Actionable guidance when `sqlite-vec` fails to open the DB

### Changed

- **Rename**: project renamed from `Agent-i-Kit` to `akm` across docs and links
- Local embeddings switched to `@huggingface/transformers`
- `@huggingface/transformers` moved to `optionalDependencies`, then promoted to a runtime dependency
- Improved semantic search setup and index UX

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Extensible asset type system**: `AkmAssetType` (formerly `AgentIKitAssetType`) is now `string` instead of a fixed union; new types can be registered at runtime via `registerAssetType()`
- **Memory asset type**: built-in `memory` type stored in `memories/`, with `memory-md` renderer and directory/parent-dir-hint matchers
- **OpenViking stash provider**: `openviking` provider type for searching OpenViking servers via REST; add with `akm stash add <url> --provider openviking`
- **Remote show for `viking://` URIs**: `akm show viking://resources/my-doc` fetches content directly from an OpenViking server (returns `editable: false`)
- **`--options` flag** for `akm registry add` and `akm stash add`: pass provider-specific JSON config (e.g., `--options '{"apiKey":"key"}'`)
- **`akm registry build-index` command**: generates a v2 registry index JSON from npm/GitHub discovery with `--out`, `--manual`, `--npmRegistry`, `--githubApi`, and `--format` flags
- Exact-name match, type-relevance, and alias boosts in the search scoring pipeline
- Ranking regression tests with a synthetic fixture stash and a 41-case benchmark suite (MRR / Recall@5)
- `estimatedTokens` on context-hub provider search results and in `--for-agent` output
- Architecture docs and test fixture for OpenViking manual testing (`tests/fixtures/openviking/`)

### Changed

- Unified context-hub indexing and fair provider scoring: local FTS scores are preserved everywhere and remote provider scores compete on equal footing
- Replaced RRF with normalized BM25 scoring across all merge paths
- EMA utility decay is now time-proportional instead of tied to index frequency
- Replaced the `(Bun as any).YAML` hack with a proper `yaml` package dependency
- YAML output format fixed; local registry refs now use a `file:` prefix

### Removed

- `manifest` subcommand (adds no value over `search`)
- URI schemes (`viking://`, `context-hub://`) from user-facing refs — assets are addressed as `type:name`; sources use URLs
- Stale audit/ergonomics markdown from the repo

### Fixed

- `skills.sh` install refs now produce valid `akm add` commands (#82)
- Prevented `akm remove` and `akm update --force` from deleting user-owned local source directories installed via path refs
- `usage_events` reverted to `DELETE` on full reindex

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

- **Rebrand**: environment variables `AGENT_I_KIT_*` renamed to `AKM_*`
- Removed `tool` asset type entirely; `script` is the only script-like type
- `.stash.json` field renames: `intents` to `searchHints`, `entry` to `filename`; removed `generated` boolean
- `show` command: `--view` flag replaced with positional syntax (`akm show <ref> toc`)
- Collapsed `AssetTypeHandler` handlers into a unified renderer pipeline
- Dropped provider presets (raw JSON config only)
- Pinned `sqlite-vec` to exact version `0.1.7-alpha.2` (removed caret range)
- Replaced `(Bun as any).YAML` cast with proper type guard in CLI
- Version now injected at compile time via `--define AKM_VERSION` with safe runtime fallback

### Changed

- Config: `installed` is now a top-level field (`config.installed`) instead of nested under `config.registry.installed`
- Config: registry URLs configured via `registries` array instead of `registryUrls`
- Documentation: complete rewrite of concepts, registry, CLI reference, README, and all technical docs
- Documentation: added "Mental Model" (registries --> kits --> stash --> assets) to concepts
