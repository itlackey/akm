# Archived plans and superseded docs

Completed implementation/design plans — plus superseded analyses and specs — moved
here once their work shipped (or their claims were overtaken) so the active
`docs/technical/` and `docs/design/` directories only hold live plans and enduring
references. These are retained as design-decision records (ADRs) — the rationale is
still useful even though the work is done. Each doc carries a 2-line banner naming
why it was archived and where current truth lives.

| `improve-vs-brain-analysis.md` | superseded by `docs/design/improve-self-learning-analysis.md` | neuroscience framing = inspiration, not justification (review 09) |
| `improve-pipeline-deep-tuning-analysis.md` | superseded by `docs/design/improve-self-learning-analysis.md` | tuning frozen per 12-D2 |

Live docs are routed from [`docs/README.md`](../README.md); unshipped designs live
in `docs/design/` until their shipping PR moves them here.
