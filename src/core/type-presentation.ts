/**
 * Chunk 1.5 (WI-1.5.1, D1.5-4) — the §2.3 "compile-time safety mitigation"
 * table for AKM's own presentation metadata.
 *
 * The open type token (this chunk) trades the deleted closed asset-type
 * union's exhaustiveness checking for a runtime lookup. `TYPE_PRESENTATION`
 * restores that exhaustiveness for AKM's OWN 14 known types (the compiler
 * demands an entry whenever {@link KnownType} gains a member), while
 * {@link presentationFor} stays open over `string` so foreign/adapter types
 * still resolve to a sane generic fallback instead of `undefined`/a throw.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `core/asset/asset-registry.ts` (deleted whole in Chunk 3)
 * and NOT `output/renderers.ts` (same fate) — this module is the durable
 * home Chunk 2/3 can point per-adapter `TYPE_PRESENTATION` tables at later.
 * `label` is the only field minted now; Chunk 2/3 own extending this shape
 * with real renderer/action wiring (asset-registry's `TYPE_TO_RENDERER`/
 * `ACTION_BUILDERS` still own that job until then — this module does not
 * replace them yet).
 *
 * ── `rendererName` (added chunk-2, WI-2.1) ──
 *
 * `BundleAdapter` (`core/adapter/bundle-adapter.ts`) has NO render/
 * presentation method — it was transcribed verbatim from the adapter spec's
 * §2 interface, which has no such member. Per the chunk-2 brief ("if the
 * BundleAdapter interface has no render method, the adapter declares its
 * renderer/presentation via the registry / TYPE_PRESENTATION, additive —
 * flag your mechanism"), this file (already the designated "durable home"
 * per the paragraph above) is where a per-adapter renderer NAME is recorded
 * — an optional field, so every pre-existing hand-written `TYPE_PRESENTATION`
 * entry stays valid without modification. Only skill/wiki/script are filled
 * in by WI-2.1 (matching `asset-registry.ts#TYPE_TO_RENDERER`'s
 * `skill-md`/`wiki-md`/`script-source` values, and the chunk-0b recognition
 * golden's `renderer` field for those three types byte-for-byte); the
 * other 11 types are left `undefined` for WI-2.2..2.5 to fill in as their
 * adapters land. This is presentation NAMING only — no `buildShowResponse`-
 * equivalent renderer FUNCTION is ported here (see the skill/wiki/script
 * adapters' own file headers): no interface hook exists for one, and it is
 * out of WI-2.1's gated scope (recognition/placement/lint parity, not
 * renderer-output parity).
 *
 * ── `workflow`/`task` (added chunk-2, WI-2.2) ──
 *
 * `workflow.rendererName` is `"workflow-md"` — the type-level DEFAULT/primary
 * form, mirroring `asset-spec.ts`'s `workflow` entry (which carries the same
 * default and lets the legacy `workflowProgramMatcher` override it
 * per-file). `workflow` has a SECOND renderer, `"workflow-program-yaml"`,
 * for its YAML-program form — this per-TYPE table cannot name two renderers
 * for one type key, so the program form's identity is carried on the
 * per-DOCUMENT `IndexDocument.rendererName` field instead (additive,
 * `core/adapter/types.ts`; see that field's doc comment and
 * `core/adapter/adapters/workflow-adapter.ts`'s header for the full
 * mechanism — flagged prominently, do not silently drop it).
