/**
 * Supporting type family for the amended `BundleAdapter` interface
 * (`./bundle-adapter.ts`), minted per akm 0.9.0 chunk-1 decision D1-1
 * (`docs/design/execution/chunk-1/brief.md`).
 *
 * Provenance, per type:
 *
 *  - `BundleId` / `ComponentId` / `ItemRef` / `BundleInstallation` /
 *    `BundleComponent` — transcribed verbatim from
 *    `docs/design/akm-0.9.0-bundle-adapter-spec.md` §1.1 (lines 56-75).
 *
 *  - `IndexDocument` — transcribed verbatim from the same doc, §3 (lines
 *    205-241). Per D1-1 this is the FULL/real shape, not a deferred
 *    placeholder: Chunk 5 later reconciles it with the `StashEntry` ->
 *    `IndexDocument` rename (a merge into this type, not a re-creation of
 *    it).
 *
 *  - `ValidateContext` — NOT restated in the adapter spec's own §2 code
 *    block (chunk-1 anchors.md §A.1); defined only in the normative spec,
 *    `docs/design/akm-format-neutral-bundle-workspace-spec.md:562-569`.
 *    Transcribed verbatim from there.
 *
 *  - `Diagnostic` — referenced as `validate`'s `Promise<Diagnostic[]>`
 *    return type by both spec documents, but its shape is declared
 *    NOWHERE (adapter spec, normative spec, plan, and decision-history all
 *    searched — 0 hits). Per D1-1, MINTED here modeled on the existing
 *    `LintIssue` (`src/commands/lint/types.ts:19-25`:
 *    `{ file, issue, detail, fixed }`), with one deliberate generalization:
 *    `issue` is an open `string` here rather than `LintIssueType` (a closed
 *    union of 12 lint-command-specific codes) — `Diagnostic` is produced by
 *    arbitrary adapters' `validate()`, not scoped to the lint command's
 *    vocabulary. Flagged for the maintainer per the brief.
 *
 * DEFERRED (not declared here): the spec's OPTIONAL authoring (§12.2), export
 * (§12.3), and memory (§12.4) facet methods reference a type family
 * (`AuthoringTarget`/`AuthoringContext`/`CreateRequest`/`BundleExport`/
 * `BindingRequest`/`BindingPlan`/`MemoryRecord`/`MemorySemanticPlan`) that NO
 * spec document shapes. Those facets are Tier-B ("no 0.9.0 adapter implements
 * these"); rather than commit 8 meaningless `Record<string, unknown>`
 * placeholders on the foundational contract, both the facet methods (on
 * `BundleAdapter`) and these types are DROPPED from chunk 1 — the owning chunk
 * of each facet adds its method + a REAL type shape when it is built. Refines
 * D1-1 (0.9.0 core contract only); flagged for the maintainer.

   * ADDITIVE chunk-2 extension (WI-2.2, the "workflow renderer wrinkle" —

   * `KnownType`, minted WI-2.1).
   *
   * Why this exists: `workflow` is ONE type with TWO on-disk forms that each
   * need their OWN renderer name (`workflow-md` vs `workflow-program-yaml` —
   * chunk-2 anchors.md §C.3), and a per-type table structurally cannot name
   * two renderers for one type key. The legacy system solved the identical
   * problem the same way: `classifyByWorkflowProgram`'s `MatchResult` names
   * `WORKFLOW_PROGRAM_RENDERER_NAME` DIRECTLY rather than going through the
   * type-keyed `rendererNameFor` lookup (`matchers.ts`'s
   * `workflowProgramMatcher`, cross-confirmed anchors.md §B.1/§C.3) — this
   * field is the `BundleAdapter`-shaped translation of that same per-file
   * override, at the natural granularity (`IndexDocument` is already the
   * per-file artifact).
   *
   * `undefined` = fall back to `TYPE_PRESENTATION[type].rendererName` (the
   * type's default/primary form — set to `"workflow-md"` for `workflow`,
   * mirroring `asset-spec.ts`'s `workflow` entry). Only the `workflow`
   * adapter's program-yaml form sets this today
   * (`core/adapter/adapters/workflow-adapter.ts`); every other WI-2.1/2.2
   * adapter leaves it `undefined` and is unaffected. Optional and additive:
   * no existing consumer reads this field, no behavior change to anything
   * that predates chunk-2 WI-2.2.
