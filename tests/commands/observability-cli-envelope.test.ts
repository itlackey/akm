/**
 * WS6 characterization test for the observability command cluster
 * (`akm log`). Pins the JSON envelope (stdout payload shape, the
 * {ok:false,code} error envelope on stderr, and exit codes) for representative
 * subcommands, proving the extraction from cli.ts into
 * src/commands/observability-cli.ts is byte-identical.
 *
 * `log` was migrated onto `defineJsonCommand`, which emits the same JSON
 * envelope (stdout/stderr/exit-code) as the inline form.
 *
 * 0.9.0 CLI overhaul (S3): `log` was a group with `list`/`tail` subcommands;
 * `tail` is dropped and `log` is now the leaf command (today's `list`
 * surface, unchanged). The `lessons`/`lesson` group (`coverage`, `strength`)
 * is dropped entirely along with its envelope tests below.
 *
 * `log tail` was intentionally not exercised here — it followed the events
 * table via a polling loop and would have made this snapshot
 * non-deterministic.
 *
 * Agent guidance is available through `akm hints` (full by default;
 * `--detail brief` for the short guide).
