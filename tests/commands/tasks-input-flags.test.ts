/**
 * P2a Lane C — `akm task run`'s exact-name input flags (spec
 * docs/plans/specs/p2a-task-source-v4.md §5.1, §1.4 "Lane C — CLI + schema +
 * docs"). This lane owns ONLY this file plus the AUTHORIZED updates to
 * tests/integration/tasks-schema.test.ts (§6 F-1).
 *
 * RED phase: task source v4 (`src/tasks/source/task-source-v4.ts`, Lane A),
 * the shared input contract (`src/execution/input-contract.ts`, Lane B), and
 * this lane's own additions — `RunTaskOptions.inputFlags` on
 * `src/tasks/run/task-result.ts`, plus this file's own test-only
 * `captureTaskInvocation` seam on that same options bag — do not exist yet.
 * Every reference to one of those not-yet-existing names carries a
 * directly-preceding
 *
 *   // @ts-expect-error P2a red-phase: <symbol> lands in Implement
 *
 * directive, per the task brief's RED-PHASE TYPE PINS contract. This mirrors
 * the convention `tests/tasks/source-v4.test.ts` and
 * `tests/execution/input-contract.test.ts` already established for this
 * phase: one pin exactly where `tsc` reports the diagnostic (the module
 * specifier line for an unresolved import; the assignment line for a
 * property TypeScript does not yet know about on an existing type), verified
 * empirically against this repo's tsconfig — never a second pin on a
 * downstream use once the name is bound.
 *
 * §0 of the spec ("What P2a is not") is binding for the first test below: a
 * *valid* input flag set is not delivered anywhere in P2a and leaves the
 * run's OBSERVABLE result byte-identical to the same run without those
 * flags (B-26). That means the claim "akm task run <id> --scope all --strict
 * passes literal inputs into the invocation" cannot be read off
 * `TaskRunResult`, stdout, or the run log — every one of those is required
 * to stay unchanged by a valid flag set (see the dedicated end-to-end
 * describe block near the bottom of this file, which pins exactly that
 * byte-identity through the REAL `akm task run` CLI path). The task brief
 * anticipates exactly this and offers two ways to assert the isolated Stage 2
 * (materialize + attach) behavior: "the run result/log or an injected seam".
 * This file uses the seam: `RunTaskOptions.captureTaskInvocation`, called
 * with the CONSTRUCTED `TaskInvocation` Stage 2 (load-task.ts) builds, once —
 * before dispatch, never read back by production code — so the load-bearing
 * assertion is `TaskInvocation.inputs` (the widened model field §4.4
 * authorizes), not a bespoke side channel. It is modeled on the
 * already-existing test-only overrides on `RunTaskOptions`
 * (`beforeNativeDispatch`, `spawnFn`, `runAgentImpl`, …,
 * src/tasks/run/task-result.ts) and is this test's OWN addition, not a name
 * the spec itself pins — if Implement satisfies "the result becomes
 * TaskInvocation.inputs" through a differently-shaped seam, update this
 * test's call site and pins to match rather than re-deriving intent. (An
 * earlier version of this file's seam handed back only a bare
 * `TaskInputBinding[]`, which a side channel production code never reads
 * could satisfy without ever attaching `.inputs` to a real `TaskInvocation`
 * — test-review finding, tests/integration/commands/tasks-input-flags.test.ts:150.)
 *
 * B-27's declared-input enumeration and B-28's underlying-detail requirement
 * (test-review finding, tests/integration/commands/tasks-input-flags.test.ts:187)
 * are pinned by checking the WHOLE serialized `{ok,error,code,hint}` envelope
 * (`JSON.stringify(envelope)`), not `.error` alone — `emitJsonError`
 * (src/cli/shared.ts:113) serializes a UsageError's `hint` into the envelope
 * too, and the workflow analogue's own "Declared parameters: …" text lives in
 * exactly that separate `hint`, not the message (params.ts:51-56).
 *
 * IMPORTANT FINDING, recorded for Implement (out of scope for this
 * test-only lane to fix): `src/cli/unknown-flags.ts`'s `assertKnownFlags`
 * rejects, BEFORE a command's own body ever runs, any flag the resolved
 * command's declared `args` does not name. Today it carves out exactly one
 * dynamic per-command flag namespace — `known.path.join(" ") ===
 * "workflow run"` (`dynamicWorkflowParams`, unknown-flags.ts:225,270) — and
 * `task run` is not in it. The spec's Lane C file list never names
 * unknown-flags.ts, but `task run`'s exact-name input flags need the
 * identical carve-out: without it, EVERY input flag on `akm task run`,
 * declared or not, valid or not, is rejected by this generic gate before
 * `materializeInputFlags` ever sees it — and (a separate, pre-existing gap,
 * see `tests/integration/cli-errors.test.ts`'s "retired flags..." test
 * comment) that specific rejection path does not even render the
 * `{ok:false,error,code}` JSON envelope through this repo's in-process CLI
 * test harness (`tests/_helpers/cli.ts`'s `runCliCapture`), only through a
 * real subprocess. The three envelope-asserting tests below drive `akm task
 * run` through `runCliCapture` and will only go green once `task run` joins
 * `assertKnownFlags`'s passthrough set (so the eventual UNKNOWN_FLAG /
 * INPUT_BINDING_INVALID is raised from INSIDE the command body, where
 * `runWithJsonErrors` already renders the proper envelope) — verified
 * empirically: today, `akm task run <id> --scope all` on a plain v3 task
 * exits 2 with the bare text `Unknown flag "--scope".` on stderr, not a JSON
 * envelope, confirming both gaps are still open at the time this file was
 * written.
